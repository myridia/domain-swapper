# Dockers Space to test and develop this Plugins
A WordPress plugin is integrated into WordPress, so the best way to work with it, is to create a minimal WordPress place where
we can work it.
The Dockers where will simulate the server, so we can access the site locally without computer.

See https://github.com/myridia/hello_haproxy_docker/tree/main for install the certificates into your browser to be able to access the local test  https domains

 
## After you run the docker-compose you can access to
```
  docker-compose up
```

*  Default Wordpress http://127.0.0.1:8080
*  phpmyadmin http://127.0.0.1:81
*  domain1  https://ww1.app.local
*  domain2  https://ww2.app.local
*  domain3  https://ww3.app.local
*  domain4  https://foo.local
